### Overview
---

This repository provides an analytical exploration of rainfall and climatic conditions across various cities in Germany. 
The project utilizes a dataset containing key geographic and meteorological data, cleaned using Excel and visualized through Power BI dashboards. 
This analysis offers insights into rainfall patterns, temperature trends, and climate types across different cities and timeframes.


### Dataset Details
---
The dataset includes the following fields:

* City: Name of the city
* Latitude: Geographic latitude of the city
* Longitude: Geographic longitude of the city
* Month: Month of the data record
* Year: Year of the data record
* Rainfall (mm): Monthly rainfall in millimeters
* Elevation (m): Elevation of the city above sea level in meters
* Climate_Type: Climate classification of the city
* Temperature (°C): Average temperature recorded (in degrees Celsius)
* Humidity (%): Average humidity percentage


### Data Enhancements
---
The dataset underwent data cleaning in Excel to ensure consistency and accuracy. It was further enhanced in Power BI to enable advanced visualizations and insights.

### Dashboards and Insights
---
The following dashboards were created in Power BI to visualize and analyze the data:

* Minimum and Maximum Latitude by City
: Displays the geographic spread of cities, emphasizing latitude variation and its influence on climatic patterns.

* Climate Type Each Month
: Maps monthly climate types for each city, showcasing seasonal variations and patterns.

* Humidity by City
: Highlights average humidity levels for each city, providing insights into regional moisture conditions.

* Average Temperature and Rainfall by City
: Displays the relationship between temperature and rainfall for each city, offering a comprehensive view of climatic conditions.

* Maximum Rainfall Monthly by City
: Identifies cities with the highest monthly rainfall, helping understand extreme weather patterns.

* Climate Type by City
: Categorizes cities based on their predominant climate type, providing a spatial overview of climate classifications.

* Average Rainfall Every Month
: Analyzes monthly rainfall trends across all cities, offering insights into seasonal precipitation variations.

* Monthly Temperature Rating
: Assigns a rating to monthly temperature trends, categorizing them as low, moderate, or high for better comparative analysis.


### Tools Used
---
* Excel: Data cleaning and preparation
* Power BI: Data transformation, visualization, and analysis


### Key Findings
---
* Coastal cities tend to experience higher humidity levels compared to inland regions.
* Rainfall patterns vary significantly across cities, with some experiencing peak rainfall during summer months and others during winter.
* Cities at higher elevations generally have lower temperatures and less rainfall compared to those at lower elevations.
* Climate type and temperature ratings reveal clear seasonal shifts, emphasizing the influence of geography on local climates.


### Conclusion
---
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Germany’s rainfall and climatic conditions, offering actionable insights for environmental researchers, city planners, and policymakers. 
It highlights the interplay of geographic and climatic factors and their impact on local weather conditions.
